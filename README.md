# ScrabbleOptimizer
The Scrabble Optimizer efficiently finds the highest value move given board state and a set of tiles.

To run a full 2-player simulation with each player driven by the solver, run *sample_game()* in *main.py*.

An exploration of a few edge cases to the algorithm are shown in the *error_cases/* directory.
